# HTML 5 Presentation in HTML5

This entire presentation is written in HTML5 format. and hence is interactive at various sections. To run this you need to start a simple http server on your system and them open the webpage index.html

I generally suggests my own [http command](https://github.com/anantshri/script-collection/blob/master/Shell/http) this does the job of finding the right server and serving the static files.

The presentation is created using combination of markdown files as source and reveal.js as presentation layer
